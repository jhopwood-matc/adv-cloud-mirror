# Mirror Repository for Advanced Scripting for Cloud

## Overview

This is a mirror of a private repository used in my Advanced Scripting for Cloud class. I created this repository to showcase my work and the projects I've completed throughout the course.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains six folders, each corresponding to the weeks of the course (starting from Week 2, as Week 1 was setup):

- **Week 2: S3**
- **Week 3: EC2**
- **Week 4: Reporting**
- **Week 5: SNS & CloudWatch**
- **Week 6: Error Handling**
- **Week 7: Security Auditing**

Each folder contains scripts and resources related to the respective weekâ€™s topics.
